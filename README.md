# HISTORICAL STOCK DATA RETRIEVAL AND ANALYSIS

## INTRODUCTION 

This project introduces a Python-based tool designed to retrieve, process, and analyse historical stock data for the NIFTY 50 index. The tool leverages the Alice Blue API to fetch minute-by-minute data, stores it efficiently, and provides resampling capabilities for more granular analysis. This solution aims to assist traders, analysts, and researchers in studying market trends and developing trading strategies based on historical price movements.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED:

* Python 3.x
* Libraries:
    * datetime: For handling date and time operations
    * pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
    * Alice Blue API (via alice_credentials module): For accessing stock market data

* Excel: For data storage and potential further analysis
